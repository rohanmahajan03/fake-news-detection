Two methods of Fake News Detection using Python, using TensorFlow and Logisitic Regression. Trained and tested on over 6000 works of text. Removed stopwords from, tokenized, and padded data. Passed preprocessed sequences into a word embedding where we kept the values from the word embedding that appeared in the texts. Passed finalized word embedding into a hybrid convolutional-recurrent neural network which I created using TensorFlow. The second method was through logistic regression, in which I employed a TF-IDF Vectorizer.
